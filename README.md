# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
To create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
To design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. compile, train, and evaluate binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.
## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
